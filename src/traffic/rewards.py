    r"""Encourage proximity to a desired velocity. Differentiable version

    This function measures the deviation of a system of vehicles from a
    user-specified desired velocity peaking when all vehicles in the ring
    are set to this desired velocity. Moreover, in order to ensure that the
    reward function naturally punishing the early termination of rollouts due
    to collisions or other failures, the function is formulated as a mapping
    :math:`r: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}
    \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}`.
    This is done by subtracting the deviation of the system from the
    desired velocity from the peak allowable deviation from the desired
    velocity. Additionally, since the velocity of vehicles are
    unbounded above, the reward is bounded below by zero,
    to ensure nonnegativity.
